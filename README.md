# Buddyblast

## TODO: Description

Let people know what your project can do specifically. Provide context and add a link to any reference visitors might be unfamiliar with. A list of Features or a Background subsection can also be added here. If there are alternatives to your project, this is a good place to list differentiating factors.

## Get Started

- Clone the repo
- Download dependencies by running `npm install` in the terminal, in the root `buddyblast` folder
  - make sure Node is installed and up-to-date, either manually or with Homebrew
- Fire up the dev environment with `npm run dev`
- Check out the prod environment by building `npm run build` and preview `npm run preview`

## Checklist

- Have you installed the recommended VSCode extensions? Check the extensions tab on the left sidebar
- Are your dependencies updated? Run `npm install`
- Have you tried reloading the window? `ctrl/cmd + shift + p` then `Developer: Reload Window`

## VSCode configuration

To improve developer experience we commit the VSCode workspace configuration.

### Extensions

- Prettier is used for good default formatting to avoid non-functional merge conflicts
- ESLint lets the team enjoy errors at compile rather than on runtime
- Conventional Commits makes it easy for the team to write good commits
- GitLab workflow makes working with GitLab easier
- npm Intellisense gives us autocomplete for npm
- Tailwind CSS Intellisense gives us autocomplete for Tailwind CSS

### Settings/Good defaults

- tabSize is set to 2 to avoid merge conflicts
- formatOnSave is a good setting to enable in combination with Prettier as the default formatter
- defaultFormatter is Prettier

## File structure

FOR DEVS: ALL of our code belongs in either `src/components/`, `src/lib/` or `src/routes/`. `lib/` should only contain `*.ts` files, while `components/` and `routes/` should only contain `*.tsx` files.

`/` or `buddyblast/` is the root of our project. Any files here are either for project configuration or documentation

- `.vscode/` contains vscode workspace configuration files
- `public/` contains public assets
- `src/` contains all code. any written code MUST be placed within a subfolder of `src/`
  - `assets/` contain private assets
  - `components/` contain our custom written component code
    - `ui/` contains all components pulled from external libraries like shadcn/ui
  - `lib/` contain reused utility code
  - `routes/` is for our file-based router containing page/route components
  - `App.tsx` sets up our React app with router and other top level logic
  - `global.css` sets up Tailwind and css variables for styling
  - `routeTree.gen.ts` is an autogenerated file from our router solution(Tanstack Query)
  - `vite-env.d.ts` is required for Vite

## Tech-stack

### Typescript

Typescript is essential for our workflow as it provides us with type safety and a better development experience (DX).

- Watch [Typescript in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/zQnBQ4tB3ZA?si=LzKRBwJrO39PUsQ0) for a quick introduction

### Linting

ESlint is used for linting. Our configs lie in .eslintrc.cjs. To manually test the linting of the project run the command

`npm run lint`

### Formatting (Prettier)

Prettier is our choice of formatter.
To manually format the project run

`npm run format`

in the app directory.\
Our team prefers to use the VSCode Prettier extension with the "Format on save" option enabled.
That way it is practically impossible to push unformatted code.

`.prettierrc` contains our configurations so everyone has the same formatting rules.
These are set to the defaults with the exception of enabling plugins.

#### Plugins

The plugins we use are:

- "prettier-plugin-organize-imports"
- "prettier-plugin-tailwindcss"

These sort and clean up our imports and tailwind classes so to avoid meaningless merge conflicts.

### React

<https://react.dev/>

Javascript frameworks are a staple of modern web development and React is our choice for its popularity and ease of use.

### Vite

<https://vitejs.dev/>

Vite is our required frontend build tool. No configuration is required outside of whats included in the repo.

### Tailwind

<https://tailwindcss.com/>

Tailwind is our choice for in-line styling.
It is popular for good reasons.
The development experience (DX) it provides lets us focus on making a good website without having to bother with the intricacies of plain css.

### shadcn/ui

<https://ui.shadcn.com/>

Shadcn/ui or Shadui for short is a collection of re-usable components that you can copy and paste into your apps.
This is not a component library in the sense that it is not a dependency.

We use shadcn/ui components as our base and build on top of the sensible defaults it provides.

### Tanstack Router

<https://tanstack.com/router/latest>

Tanstack Router is a bleeding edge type-safe router w/ built-in caching & URL state management for React.
This is required for us to be able to share URL's to different pages in our app, and with state like search params.

- [Tanstack Router Tutorial](https://youtu.be/uBzDkDqTQV0?si=ozEmPhyS_hX70Y15)

### Firebase

Firebase is our chosen solution for backend. We would rather have Google manage our backend instead of building our own from scratch.

- [Firebase in 100 seconds](https://youtu.be/vAoB4VbhRzM?si=ksssPyZJHiuYsU_M)

For local testing, do the following:

- Run in teminal: "firebase emulators:start".
- Then go to lib/firebase.ts and change the testLocalFlag variable to 1.
- When done, you should be able to just run the app normally with "npm run dev" and it will be connected to the local firestore session.

## Commit messages

We follow the conventional commits specifications described in <https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/>

[more concise and web oriented document](https://gist.github.com/qoomon/5dfcdf8eec66a051ecd85625518cfd13)

We also use the conventional commits VSCode extension for ease of use
